# TCP-ROOM 🏠💬

Welcome to the TCP-ROOM project! 🚪🔌

TCP-ROOM is a simple chat room application built using TCP sockets in Python. It consists of two main components: `client.py` and `server.py`. When the server starts, it listens on a socket for TCP connections. Multiple clients can join the chat room and communicate with each other, with all communication being handled by the server.

## Overview 📝

TCP-ROOM provides a platform for users to join a virtual room and engage in real-time text-based communication. The server acts as a central hub, facilitating communication between clients by relaying messages.

## Features 🌟

- Real-time chat functionality
- Support for multiple clients
- Server-managed communication

## Files 📁

- `client.py`: Client-side script for joining the chat room.
- `server.py`: Server-side script for managing client connections and communication.

## Usage 🚀

### Server
```python server.py```
Starts the server and listens for incoming connections on a TCP socket.

### Client
```python client.py``` 
Launches the client application to join the chat room.

## How to Use 🤔

1. Start the server by running `server.py`.
2. Run multiple instances of `client.py` to simulate multiple clients joining the chat room.
3. Clients can send messages that will be relayed to all other clients connected to the server.
